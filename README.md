I# Zodiac TLS/SSL  [![Build Status](https://github.com/GsDevKit/zodiac/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=gs_master)](https://github.com/GsDevKit/zodiac/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Zodiac is an open-source, cross-smalltalk implementation of regular and secure socket streams. 
The primary goal of the project is to offer TLS/SSL streams that can then be used to implement 
for example HTTPS when combined with a suitable client such as Zinc HTTP Components.
